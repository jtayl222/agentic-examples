# Why You Shouldn't Use `@tool` in LangGraph's StateGraph Workflows

## Introduction

LangGraph has introduced a more structured approach to state management in AI workflows, shifting away from previous agentic patterns. One major question that arises when using tools like Tavily Search is whether to annotate functions with `@tool`. In this article, we'll explore why `@tool` is unnecessary in a `StateGraph`, why this method is superior to previous integrations, and whether `ToolNode` should be deprecated.

## The Role of `StateGraph` in LangGraph

`StateGraph` provides a structured way to manage state transitions in LangGraph workflows. Instead of relying on autonomous decision-making like in LangChain agents, `StateGraph` ensures deterministic execution, where each function updates a shared state dictionary.

This structured approach allows developers to:
- **Control workflow execution** explicitly, avoiding unpredictable agent behavior.
- **Manage state updates more effectively** by modifying only relevant parts of the state.
- **Improve maintainability** by keeping functions simple and avoiding tool registration overhead.

## Why You Should **Not** Use `@tool` in `search_with_tavily`

In LangChain‚Äôs agent-based models, `@tool` is used to register functions dynamically so that an LLM can decide when and how to invoke them. However, `StateGraph` works differently:

‚ùå **`@tool` is unnecessary because:**
- `search_with_tavily` is **explicitly** added as a node (`workflow.add_node("search", search_with_tavily)`). LangGraph directly calls this function, making `@tool` redundant.
- `@tool` is primarily for **LLM-based decision-making**, while `StateGraph` follows **deterministic execution**.
- The function **does not need to be listed as an available tool**, since it's part of a controlled flow.

Using `@tool` in this case **adds no benefit** and could cause confusion about how the function is used.

## Why This is Better Than Previous Tavily Integrations

### üîç Comparing with LangChain‚Äôs Tool Integration
LangChain provides an integration for Tavily Search ([Docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/tavily_search/)), which allows an LLM agent to decide when to call the search function. However, this approach has several drawbacks:

| Feature                     | LangChain Agent + Tavily Tool  | LangGraph `StateGraph` |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| Execution Control          | LLM decides dynamically       | Deterministic         |
| State Management           | Implicit                      | Explicit & Controlled |
| Complexity                 | Higher                        | Lower                 |
| Reproducibility            | Unpredictable                 | Predictable           |

LangGraph‚Äôs approach **improves reliability, maintainability, and control** by structuring state updates explicitly.

## The Evolution of `NodeTool` in LangGraph

LangGraph previously introduced `NodeTool` as a way to streamline tool integration within workflows. However, this feature has since been replaced due to the need for more flexible and maintainable state management. The transition away from `NodeTool` allows for greater customization and direct state modifications using **state reducers and tools**.

üöÄ **Why `NodeTool` Was Deprecated:**
- Originally introduced to **simplify invoking external APIs and tools**, but it lacked flexibility.
- Managing **dynamic state updates** was difficult when using `NodeTool`.
- The new approach provides **better control over agent behavior**, **state persistence**, and **modular tool interactions**.

### Should `ToolNode` Be Deprecated?
Given the improvements in **state management and workflow control**, `ToolNode` (similar to `NodeTool`) is **becoming obsolete**. Instead of relying on predefined tool execution, developers can now **modify state explicitly** in a structured manner, eliminating the need for dedicated tool nodes.

## Conclusion
If you're transitioning to LangGraph, **stop using `@tool` in stateful workflows**. Instead, rely on `StateGraph` to define deterministic state updates, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and full execution control.
